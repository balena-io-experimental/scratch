# Build a Scratch server using a Raspberry Pi and balena

Turn your Raspberry Pi 4 (2, 4 or 8Gb model) into a Scratch3 coding rig! The fastest way to get going is to use the Deploy with balena button (after logging into your free balenaCloud account).

## Description
This project will run [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) Desktop on your Raspberry Pi, allowing you to learn how to code using [blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming)). If you add a [Sense Hat](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/?resellerType=home) to your Pi, you can enable the Sense HAT blocks:<br/>

...and make use of the LEDs, joystick and on-board sensors. You can also enable the GPIO blocks (---^) and learn to interact with lots of other hardware you add.
Have fun!!

## Hardware required
* Raspberry Pi 4 (2, 4, or 8Gb model)
* SD card (we recommend the 16Gb Sandisk Extreme)
* HDMI TV or Monitor
* Keyboard
* Mouse
* A Sense HAT(optional - but more fun!)

## Software required
* A free [balenaCloud account](https://dashboard.balena-cloud.com/signup) (first ten devices are free and fully-featured, no credit card needed to start)
* A tool to flash OS images to SD cards, like [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
