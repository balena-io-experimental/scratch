Turn your Raspberry Pi 4 (2, 4 or 8Gb model) into a Scratch3 coding rig!

## Description
This project will run [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) Desktop on your Raspberry Pi, allowing you to learn how to code using [blocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming)). If you add a [Sense Hat](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/?resellerType=home) to your Pi, you can enable the Sense HAT blocks:<br/>
![sensehatblock](https://i.ibb.co/fnbnCQp/scratch-3-desktop-for-raspbian-on-raspberry-pi-2.png)

and make use of the LEDs, joystick and on-board sensors. You can also enable the GPIO blocks (---^) and learn to interact with lots of other hardware you add.
Have fun!!
